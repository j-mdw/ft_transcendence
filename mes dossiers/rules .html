	<h1>	PONG RULES - HOW TO PLAY IF YOU WERE NOT BORN IN 1972</h1>
	<h2>Classic game</h2>
	<p>Each player has a paddle, well…, what should be a paddle, but is only a line. Player 1 controls his paddle with ‘w’ to go up and ’s’ to go down. Player 2 controls his paddle with ‘arrow up’ and ‘arrow down’ (I let you guess which one moves the paddle up…)
		The game is like a ping pong game, you have to send back the ball with your paddle.
		You’re the winner when you hit the  <strong>fabulous</strong>  score of <strong> 5</strong> !</p>

	<h2>Rookie game</h2>
	<p>Your opponent is too strong ? You’re completely drunk ? Play the rookie mode !
		Length of the paddle will be adapted to your drinking level.</p>

	<h2>Multiballs game</h2>

	<p>Long games are so boring ! Let put all the balls together to decide which player is the best.</p>

	<h1>ENJOY !</h1>
