      <h2>	PONG RULES - HOW TO PLAY IF YOU WERE NOT BORN IN 1972</h2>
      <h3>Classic game</h3>
      <p>
        Each player has a paddle, well…, what should be a paddle, but is only a line. Each player controls his paddle with 'arrow up' to go up and 'arrow down' to go down.
        The game is like a ping pong game, you have to send back the ball with your paddle.
        You’re the winner when you hit the  <strong>fabulous</strong>  score of <strong> 5</strong> !
      </p>

      <h3>Rookie game</h3>
      <p>
        Your opponent is too strong ? You’re completely drunk ? Play the rookie mode !
        Length of the paddle will be adapted to your drinking level.
      </p>

      <h3>Multiballs game</h3>

      <p>Long games are so boring ! Let put all the balls together to decide which player is the best.</p>

      <h2>ENJOY !</h2>
